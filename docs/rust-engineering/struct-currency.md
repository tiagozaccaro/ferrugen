## Don't define preludes (M-NO-PRELUDE) { #M-NO-PRELUDE }

<why>a clean namespace and reliable downstream builds.</why>

Crates must not define a `prelude` or any namespace intended to be imported as `use foo::*`.

While the Rust Standard Library successfully uses [preludes](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/prelude/index.html) to define edition items, preludes in crates cause more harm than good. Given today's IDE support they are not needed, and once multiple preludes are used from different crates there is potential for conflicts:

```rust,ignore
use foo::prelude::*;
use bar::prelude::*;
use baz::prelude::*;

_ = Client::new();

// error[E0659]: `Client` is ambiguous
//   --> src/lib.rs:17:13
//    |
// 17 |     _ = Client; 
//    |         ^^^^^^ ambiguous name
//    |
//    = note: ambiguous because of multiple glob imports of a name in the same module
```

Preludes in particular do not resolve bad module design. If it looks like a prelude would make the crate easier to use or understand, this is almost always an indication that the existing module system needs restructuring, see [M-BALANCED-MODULES](./#M-BALANCED-MODULES).



## Parameter ordering is consistent (M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY) { #M-PARAMETER-CONSISTENCY }

<why>low development friction.</why>

When the same conceptual parameters appear in multiple functions (within a crate or across crates in the same ecosystem), they should appear in the same order everywhere:

- important or call-specific parameters should generally go first,
- ubiquitous parameters rather go last (e.g., `&logger`),
- closures always go last (functions should not accept more than one closure).

```rust,ignore
// Bad, the order of `user_id` and `tenant_id` flips between functions, and
// the logger sometimes appears first, sometimes last.
fn create_user(logger: &Logger, user_id: UserId, tenant_id: TenantId) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, tenant_id: TenantId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }

// Good, call-specific parameters first in a consistent order, ubiquitous
// `logger` always last.
fn create_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn delete_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
fn rename_user(tenant_id: TenantId, user_id: UserId, new_name: &str, logger: &Logger) -> Result<()> { ... }
```



## Services are Clone (M-SERVICES-CLONE) { #M-SERVICES-CLONE }

<why>composable sharing of common services.</why>

Heavyweight _service_ types and 'thread singletons' should implement shared-ownership `Clone` semantics, including any type you expect to be used from your `Application::init`.

Per thread, users should essentially be able to create a single resource handler instance, and have it reused by other handlers on the same thread:

```rust,ignore
impl ThreadLocal for MyThreadState {
    fn init(...) -> Self {

        // Create common service instance possibly used by many.
        let common = ServiceCommon::new();

        // Users can freely pass `common` here multiple times
        let service_1 = ServiceA::new(&common);
        let service_2 = ServiceA::new(&common);

        Self { ... }
    }
}
```

Services then simply clone their dependency and store a new _handle_, as if `ServiceCommon` were a shared-ownership smart pointer:

```rust,ignore
impl ServiceA {
    pub fn new(common: &ServiceCommon) -> Self {
        // If we only need to access `common` from `new` we don't have
        // to store it. Otherwise, make a clone we store in `Self`.
        let common = common.clone();
    }
}
```

Under the hood this `Clone` should **not** create a fat copy of the entire service. Instead, it should follow the `Arc<Inner>` pattern:

```rust, ignore
// Actual service containing core logic and data.
struct ServiceCommonInner {}

#[derive(Clone)]
pub ServiceCommon {
    inner: Arc<ServiceCommonInner>
}

impl ServiceCommon {
    pub fn new() {
        Self { inner: Arc::new(ServiceCommonInner::new()) }
    }

    // Method forwards ...
    pub fn foo(&self) { self.inner.foo() }
    pub fn bar(&self) { self.inner.bar() }
}
```



## Abstractions don't visibly nest (M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS) { #M-SIMPLE-ABSTRACTIONS }

<why>low cognitive load and a good out-of-the-box UX.</why>

When designing your public types and primary API surface, avoid exposing nested or complex parametrized types to your users.

While powerful, type parameters introduce a cognitive load, even more so if the involved traits are crate-specific. Type parameters
become infectious to user code holding on to these types in their fields, often come with complex trait hierarchies on their own, and
might cause confusing error messages.

From the perspective of a user authoring `Foo`, where the other structs come from your crate:

```rust,ignore
struct Foo {
    service: Service // Great
    service: Service<Backend> // Acceptable
    service: Service<Backend<Store>> // Bad

    list: List<Rc<u32>> // Great, `List<T>` is simple container,
                        // other types user provided.

    matrix: Matrix4x4 // Great
    matrix: Matrix4x4<f32> // Still ok
    matrix: Matrix<f32, Const<4>, Const<4>, ArrayStorage<f32, 4, 4>> // ?!?
}
```

_Visible_ type parameters should be avoided in _service-like_ types (i.e., types mainly instantiated once per thread / application that are often passed
as dependencies), in particular if the nestee originates from the same crate as the service.

Containers, smart-pointers and similar data structures obviously must expose a type parameter, e.g., `List<T>` above. Even then, care should
be taken to limit the number and nesting of parameters.

To decide whether type parameter nesting should be avoided, consider these factors:

- Will the type be **named** by your users?
  - Service-level types are always expected to be named (e.g., `Library<T>`),
  - Utility types, such as the many [`std::iter`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/index.html) types like `Chain`, `Cloned`, `Cycle`, are not
    expected to be named.
- Does the type primarily compose with non-user types?
- Do the used type parameters have complex bounds?
- Do the used type parameters affect inference in other types or functions?

The more of these factors apply, the bigger the cognitive burden.

As a rule of thumb, primary service API types should not nest _on their own volition_, and if they do, only 1 level deep. In other words, these
APIs should not require users having to deal with an `Foo<Bar<FooBar>>`. However, if `Foo<T>` users want to bring their own `A<B<C>>` as `T` they
should be free to do so.
