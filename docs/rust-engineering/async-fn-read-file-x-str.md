> ### <tip></tip> The Cost of Send
>
> Ideally, there would be abstractions that are `Send` in work-stealing runtimes, and `!Send` in thread-per-core models based on non-atomic
> types like `Rc` and `RefCell` instead.
>
> Practically these abstractions don't exist, preventing Tokio compatibility in the non-atomic case. That in turn means you would have to
> "reinvent the world" to get anything done in a thread-per-core universe.
>
> The good news is, in most cases atomics and uncontended locks only have a measurable impact if accessed more frequently than every 64 words or so.

> Working with a large `Vec<AtomicUsize>` in a hot loop is a bad idea, but doing the occasional uncontended atomic operation from otherwise thread-per-core
> async code has no performance impact, but gives you widespread ecosystem compatibility.
